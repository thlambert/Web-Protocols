# Web_Protocols_Final_Project
Platteville market place web application. 
Project Description
Thomas Lambert - Derek Schultz - Jake Green - Noreen Rodrigues
Outline
Our project is a Platteville MarketPlace. Students and community members can post items for sale and purchase items clients post. This could be a range of items including radios, TV, Stereo systems, toasters, microwaves, and other appliances and amenities.
Goal
To provide an easy to use web application to buy and sell unwanted items. Any Platteville community member can login to post items for sale. It would encourage the small business economy and allow students and community members alike to make some extra money.
Pitfalls
Users may not use the service due to other competitors such as Facebook marketplace. Some programming challenges would include security and managing the server and database.
Resources
Between the four members in our group. We can split development and testing efficiently in a team of four. Once the site is running, there will have to be maintenance done by one of our group members. Development may take several weeks. The application should be scalable to 1,000 clients. 
Design Roadmap
The first step in our design process will be to design what data our database will need to set up our database.  The next step will be to design the UI for our website.  We will need a page to view the local listings and a page to list an item.  After the UI design is finalized, we will integrate our database into the project.  The final step will be to create the backend code.
Timeline
We will create milestones and split up the work of the project between group members. We aim to finish this project by the end of the semester. The end date is the 15th week of the semester which ends on 12/13/2019.
